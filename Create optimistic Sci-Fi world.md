Inspired by some games that show a positive cyberpunk world, I want to dig a little into what that would look like in my game world.

So, I used Midjourney to create this picture:

And then I use ChatGPT to create backgrounds. From left to right:
 - [[Character Nova]]
 - [[Character Trinity]]


#todo 
- [ ] create third character
- [ ] create fourth character
- [ ] write blog post about the world map?
- [ ] finish drawing world map? and how to with the pen having no cap and therefore not being recognised.


# Notes

Someone posted [this overview of open RPG systems](https://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Open_Game_Systems). I hope I can use one of them for my purposes. Overall the whole wiki-centered community might be interesting for me.
