Inspired by some games that show a positive cyberpunk world, I want to dig a little into what that would look like in my game world.

So, I used Midjourney to create this picture:
![[erikbcoins_cyberpunk_team_five_people_looking_at_camera_jet_set_ddf77361-2d81-4624-8278-5b78728d65a2.png]]

And then I use ChatGPT to create backgrounds. From left to right:
 - [[Character Nova]]
 - [[Character Trinity]]


#todo 
- [ ] create third character
- [ ] create fourth character
- [ ] write blog post about the world map?
- [ ] finish drawing world map? and how to with the pen having no cap and therefore not being recognised.


# Notes

Someone posted [this overview of open RPG systems](https://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Open_Game_Systems). I hope I can use one of them for my purposes. Overall the whole wiki-centered community might be interesting for me.


# Role Playing Systems

I could write my own, but why not use the time for more specific topics and use something open and more general, like:
 - [BIND RPG (GPL)](https://bindrpg.itch.io/)
 - [Eclipse Phase (CC-BY-NC-SA)](https://eclipsephase.com/game/)
 - [Shadows(CC)](https://mozai.com/writing/not_mine/shadows.html) - I more like the idea of this one, that your own Jungian Shadow is playing against you, rather than the whole system.
 - [Executive Decision (CC-BY-NC-SA)](http://www.gregstolze.com/execdecis.html) - political crisis simulator without dices
 - [FATE (Fudge license and OGL)](https://www.faterpg.com/dl/FATE2fe.pdf) - DnD like simplified
