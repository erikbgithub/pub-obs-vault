open source non-profit github clone from Germany? https://codeberg.org/
Contained a reminder for Wesnoth: https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Project
There are apparently RPGs developed on top of Wesnoth code and content. This is pretty much also what I thought about as a starting point. Taking an already existing complex system to build on top, so there is complexity and depth.
I'm also surprised how active the github repo of Wesnoth seems to be. It's a really well done engine, but I would be surprised if there are really many people who play the base game and campaigns for decades wihtout it getting bored to them.

This [quest list](http://dnt.dnteam.org/docs/dnt_walkthrough.txt) might be an interesting overview of how to craft interesting quests. I like especially that simply following the task given (e.g. install Ruindows) might not give as much XP as another, more creative solution (e.g. install Gentoo instead).
