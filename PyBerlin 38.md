Happy to rejoin the Pythonistas. :)
Apparently, PyBerlin has a [github.io page](https://pyberlin.github.io), which I immediately make a [small commit](https://github.com/pyberlin/pyberlin.github.io/pull/1) to.

Would be great to help organise the next event.

Doctari, the host of this event, matches doctors and hospitals. Not sure what they do with Python, but it was a great location.

Christian Maureira-Fredes (CMaurier) gave a very passionate talk about why you should contribute to Open Source.

Little notes from other talks:
Ayudapy Platform for inding and giving help
Redi School offers tech education for migrant, minority and disadvantaged groups of people, and is looking for volunteers. Looks really good!
Learned about their tooling:
 - e.g. [here's a Microbit project based on a YT tutorial](https://makecode.microbit.org/_dK628a6kof6H).
 - ozobot seems to be used as well

MusicLM might be an AI to generate music with.
