# The World
The leaders of Earth struggle. While they have a whole planet to govern, they cannot find enough talented people to stay on Earth and lead. The lure of Mars is too strong for the young.
Therefore, they have slowly reduced the ability of the poor to use modern technology. If nobody watches YouNews, nobody learns about Mars, and nobody wants to leave.
Also, they hold tests, called The Maze, to filter the talented people out of the "dirty masses". But, due to the fear of losing talent to Mars, over time new methods slipped into the tests that erode the talent filtering mechanism. One element is that the mazes can be moved and reshaped by the test organisation during the test. This enables the testers to choose who they want to allow to find the exits, and who would stay stuck forever.
And to make sure the people they help win stay loyal to them after the test, the tester send secret agents into the testing pool as well, who should check the loyalty of the tested towards the goals of the testers and the tested's faith in their leaders.
The leaders can see that slowly but surely the quality of the people they filter get worse, and other power structures emerge that challenge their leadership, while their actual goal of finding skillfull help and a next generation that can take over their chairs when they get old, seems more and more unlikely...

# Mouse

Mouse is a blind non-binary teenager who grows up in a world where only the people can survive that are strong enough to take what they need. They are laughed off and excluded by their peers as uncapable of survival. They spend their time begging for food. By coincidence and out of being bored, they find a maze at a farmers market that was designed for children. And as there is candy, ie food, as a reward, Mouse tries it. To the surprise of everybody Mouse solves the maze very quickly, having learned to trust their sense of touch and their trained ability to create maps in their memory. People cheer them on for the first time in their life. From this day on, Mouse is not a beggar any more. Mouse is a Maze Wizard. Their new purpose is to find mazes and solve them quicker than anybody else!
Until one day, they hear about the government doing huge Maze tournaments and that you can even get rich if you win one of these...
