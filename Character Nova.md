# Short Intro

Me: Create character background. Trans-woman, orange wild hair, headband, headset, bay workers union symbol on jacket, face tattoo, cyberpunk world, optimistic
ChatGPT: **In a cyberpunk world where corporations reign supreme and the divide between the haves and have-nots is greater than ever, our protagonist stands out wiht her vibrant orange wild hair and headband. She is a trans-woman who is a member of the Bay Workers Union, as symbolized by the emblem on her jacket. She's optimistic and fierce, with a face tattoo that tells the story of her struggles and triumphs. She wears a headset, indicating her proficiency in technology, and her determination to use it to fight for the rights of the working class. Despite the bleak world around her, she holds onto hope and works tirelessly to make a better future for herself and those around her.**

Me: What's her name?
ChatGPT: Her name is **Nova**.
Me: What are Nova's dreams?
ChatGPT: Nova's dreams are to live in a world where everyone is treated with equality and respect, regardless of their gender identity, and to use her skills in technology to empower the working class and fight against the oppressive corporations that control their lives. She wants to see the Bay Workers Union grow stronger and more effective in their efforts to improve the lives of the marginalized, and to be a leader within the union and within her community.

Additionally, Nova dreams of one day being able to live her life fully and openly as her true self without fear of discrimination or persecution. She longs for a world where she can be accepted and loved for who she is, and where all trans individuals can live with the same freedom and dignity.
Me: Why did Nova get a tattoo?
[...] I didn't like hte answer, as it was referencing too much of what we already knew about the character. Therefore, I explored a little more with using ChatGPT as information gatherer. E.g., what are reasons to wear tattoos, what are different tattoo styles, what are symbols that could be used for a tattoo.

I decided to redraw two ideas, and finally went with a full face, colorful Lotus tattoo. This is a symbol of rebirth and overcoming adversity.

Me: Exampls of adversity young trans-woman
ChatGPT (shortened):
 1. Discrimination and harassment
 2. Lack of acceptance
 3. Limited access to healthcare
 4. Social isolation
 5. Lack of legal protection
 6. Mental health issues
 7. Limited access to education
 8. Difficulty finding employment

# Short story: Nova in school

Me: Tell a story how Nova overcame social isolation in school
ChatGPT: **Nova was a young trans-woman who had just started her transition during her first year of high school. She was excited to start a new chapter of her life, but soon found that it was not as easy as she had hoped. She was bullied and harassed by her classmates because of her gender identity. She was also ignored and exclued by her classmates, which made her feel alone and isolated.
Nova felt that she had no one t otalk to and no one who understood what she was going through. She would spend her lunchtime in the library, avoiding the stares and whispers of her classmates. She felt like she didn't belong and that she was the only one going through this.
One day, while Nova was sitting in the library, she overheard a group of students talking about their experience with the school's Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA) club. She was intrigued and decided to check it out.
At the next meeting, Nova walked into the GSA club room and was greeted by a group of students who welcomed her with open arms. They were all LGBTQ+ students who were also facing similar challenges. They told her about hteir struggles and how they had found support and acceptance in the club.
For the first time in a long time, Nova felt like she belonged. She finally had a group of people who understood her and who she could talk to. She found solace in the club started to open up about her own struggles. The club members listened and supported her. They gave her the strength and confidence to stand up for herself and to speak out against the bullying and aharassment she was facing.
Nova found a sense of community and belonging in the GSA club. She finally felt like she was not alone. She started to come out of her shell and to participate in class and school activities. She also became an active member of the club and helped to create a more inclusive and accepting school culture.
Over time, Nova's classmates started to see her as a person, not just as a trans-woman. They began to accept and respect for who she was. She eventually graduated rom high school with a sense of accomplishment and the knowledge that she had overcome the social isolation she had faced.**




Additional from me not in the chat:
She felt reborn after gaining her confidence and that she had made a major progress in her life. Therefore, she decided to get a colorful lotus tattoo.

# Exploring Want and Need

[[Howto Create a Character]]

Once Nova fell in love with a fellow band member Treen. Everyone could see it, but everyone was also surprised why she didn't act on her feelings at all. Today is the last day of Treen in the band. What will Nova do?

Options:
 1. Confess her love as if it just came up as a new idea. - Nova would be ashamed to act like that about something so important like love.
 2. Acting like it would be nothing. - She might do that if the woman didn't touch her heart that much. But with Treen that's not an option.
 3. Confronting Treen why she never spoke about her feelings for Nova. - In other cases Nova might look for an opportunity to blame her faults externally. But in love this would be too hurtful to the relationship.
 4. Tell her about her feelings and how her trans identity might make the life of Treen harder as well. - Avoiding the actual topic might be something she would choose to do out of fear.
 5. Tell her about how her previous two love interests died while working with her for her cause, making her believe that her love is what killed them. - That's her actual reason, but she didn't admit that fear to herself yet. She might not say it .
 6. Not going to the party at all, explaining to herself why she would be alright without Treen. - Not possible here.
 7. Bringing another woman to the party and constantly flirting with her, hoping to make Treen jealous. - She did that before and the end result was too painful for everyone involved.
 8. Asking other band members for help. - She would never do that, as this would be against her ideas of independence and strength.
 9. Starting a fight with Treen why loyalty to the band is important and how it isn't just a hobby for her. - Another way to avoid hte actual topic. she might do that.
 10. Write her an anonymous love letter and see how she reacts. - Too romantic for Nova.

End result might be something between 4 and 9. Maybe starting with 9 but already failing and falling back to 4, revealing that there is more to her claim than she admits.
