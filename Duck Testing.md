"Well, it has a beak. Maybe it's a duck?", the tester thought. He tries a lot to make it quack. But it doesn't. He tries again, does all the tricks. Even giving it some dry bread. It simply doesn't quack.
He goes to his friend and says, "I have a broken duck. It doesn't quack!"
The friend is also a tester, and so agrees to take a look.
When they both come back to the faulty duck, it looks away from them.
The friend says: "Oh my! This is not a duck! Can't you see? It's a beaver!"
So they both agree it must be a beaver. They give it some wood to chew.
But again, it doesn't chew the wood. Like, not at all. It ignores it completely.
So the tester says to his friend: "Well, you see. I was wrong at calling it a duck. But I am absolutely right at calling it broken!"
The friend is frustrated but can't say anything against the argument. "Oh my. But, I know just the guy who might help us fix this beaver! Let's go!"

To be continued...
quack.
