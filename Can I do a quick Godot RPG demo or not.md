To figure out my natural process a little, I want to document this time what I'm doing.

My initial idea was to build a fantasy world where both magic and rural/tribal life come together (and clash with) high-performance industrial life in a [[Create optimistic Sci-Fi world|optimistic sci-fi city]], and then build games there. Cooking simulator, maybe rythm games, maybe a trading card game, there are different ideas.

Inspired from a YT video about [Divinity Original Sin 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taHk8leX0mw&t=850s) that popped up a few times in my YT suggestions, and that a lot of the world building content on YT is actually for Pen&Paper RPGs, and then [this article about an open game system license from the creators of Pathfinder for every other game developer who wants to build on top of their system](https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si7v), I started wondering if I should aim in the direction of an RPG system, too.

Now, I'm pretty sure it would be either a very simple system, where then a card game would make more sense than a real RPG, or it would be too complex for a single person to finish. So it can't be my next step. But my next step could consider what such a future would look like where I would lead a team to build an RPG.

Therefore, I want to explore what I could do as a quick demo.

And therefore, I watch YT videos about how to build a small RPG system.

A few videos where pretty abstract without going much into any details. Also not many insights that are beyond general game dev advise. So no point in mentioning them.
A small interesting point of [one video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_zvpjyP1xA) was maybe that an RPG system is not a single system, but a set of more specific systems, e.g. a grid-based world system, a character system, a turn-action resolution system, and a combat system.

This [grid-based movement tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9laHKHYNyXc) is the first that goes into some details. It's too detailed, but at least to the point. There needs to be a translation from the grid system to the pixel-on-screen system. Feedback to the user can come through animation (e.g. character shakes a little if it cannot move, showing it tried but failed).
