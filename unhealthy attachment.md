Met another woman that was very exciting but also dangerous for me.

My assumption was that when I reach this stage of awareness, that such kind of women would become completely uninteresting to me, and I would simply move on to get attracted to healthier women. The last point is true. I notice and get attracted to healthier women and altogether a wider range of women. I can't say that I get less interested in these unhealthy encounters, though. I definitely invest less into it. But there were a lot of points where I felt that either or both would benefit from a better connection, and that it's a pity that I don't see any healthy options to find or build that connection. Maybe it's possible when both have a high level of self awareness, and can smile a little about how the actions of the other trigger reactions in oneself?

While I feel a strong desire to reproduce in these situations, I don't believe her goal, even subconscious, is reproduction. I think her goal is human connection. When I told her I'm attracted to her, her face expression read like: finally, someone who actually gives a shit about me. And the same way I felt drawn into this, I could see her face reflecting similar emotions about what she saw in me.

And I think the benefits of human connection are huge, not just for her, but for society. Because having no connections is definitely unhealthy, and an unhealthy environment leads to overcompensation, as in overperformance in luring partners, and overperformance in the asocial behavior. Human connection can reduce both areas to whatever the biological lower threshold is.

Two questions result for me from this:
1) Can we find another way to compensate for the asocial parts of the connection besides sex?
2) Can we have sex without reproducing?

For (1) I already tried a few options, but was confronted with a strong filter that only would have allowed sexual contact. Even simple small talk or just sitting together while eating breakfast was actively blocked. I sensed only silence, distance, verbal abuse, and "take me now" body language. And the last was the only one that came with a proactive attention seeking approach. The rest was more reactive, or silence. If we want people to choose their own path in life, that's the choice I could see.

So, the two positive things I received are this open face expression that shows an interest for human connection, and a strong push for a sexual encounter. Both came with verbal abuse and blaming though.

This made me react in an abstract leaning back. I tried to show multiple options to connect on a human level and showed that I would be also interested in sex. But I didn't engage on a physical level, or by commenting her body, or showing off some sexy moves myself or similar. I felt like this whole territory was very dangerous. Men are dangerous, men always harass women, a man being attracted to a woman must mean it's sexual, sexual desire in a man must mean harassment, etc. I feel like if physical closeness with women would be more common in my life, I would still have more options like taking her hand, massages, hugs, until she pro-actively refuses these, which is not unlikely. But as I don't have enough experience, I couldn't engage without risking losing my accommodation.

### Conclusion

For me personally I can say, if I never get into such a situation again, I probably won't be too sad. I'm happy to experiment more, though, as I can clearly see the possible benefits of success. I will actively disengage only when I don't think sex can be part of the equation, e.g. with a child or blood relative.
