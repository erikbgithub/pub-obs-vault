Introduced by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BxfV1sBRJs).
Want = visible goal, the thing the character actively pursues.
Want is opposed by external Antagonism.

Need = what char needs to discover about themselves.
Need(?) supposedly comes from the Lie character believes.
Often it is a `if I do X then I get Y` formula, which might not actually be true.

There might be short-term immediate wants for each step of their journey. e.g. big want is to become famous, but immediate goal is to join a band.

Need might be unchanged, throughout the story.

Found another [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0txdzPfC-Ow&list=PLEzQZpmbzckXbUG2PiEJ5ic8NgIaWe1se) that goes more in-depth into four different endings that can happen around meeting needs and wants in stories.


Flat Arc - character changes the world around them, not themselves.

Hm. The content was good, but it seems the problem space is more complex than that.

For instance, my view on Rain Man:
 - Lie: Charlie doesn't believe connection to other people is possible, therefore he only cares for money.
 - He doesn't miss the connection to his father because there was none. This is also the reason why he believes the lie: If there is no connection possible with an important person like his father, then probably connection is not possible at all.
 - He's frustrated about not getting the money. Therefore, he Wants the money and find out who gets it.
 - When he learns that the recipient is his brother and that as a child he had a real connection with him, his Want steps back behind his Need: real connection.
 - A new Lie emerges: All the desire for connection has to happen between Charlie and Raymond. And also a new Want: Keeping that connection alive with Raymond. That doesn't exist anymore, though, because Charlie is now a grown-up.
 - End: He needs to let go of this one connection so he can carry the Truth out into his life: Real connection is possible, it was just not possible with his father.

He never wants to take care of Raymond. He just doesn't know what "taking care" means. He wants to keep the connection alive that he found in their shared past, when they both have been children.

I didn't realise in the Social Network that Zuckerberg tries to reconnect with his Ex from the beginning, Erica. I thought he wanted to make a new connection with the lawyer woman who thought he might not be an asshole.
