# Journaling
Went to the government organisation who will help me get an apartment. Optimistic about it, but might be a slow process.
Also went to the police station where I could change my living location on my ID card to my current homeless status. But it's unclear what the next step is. They seem to be only open on Tuesday, open on 2 pm, but it's unclear when they close, and apparently they are already closed when I arrived at 3.30 pm. Only could talk to the gate guard downstairs, though.
Received a "no" for my application at REWE.
Started writing a short story.
