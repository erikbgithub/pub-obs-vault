# Journaling

Did too much running around to organise stuff over the last days. It doesn't bode well with standing in the cold for 2 hours and sleeping with sick people in the same room.
I also think it's not necessary to do too much. I feel like part of me wants to get out of this situation quickly. But there might not be a way. Instead it might be better to do a little every day and focus on having a regular day schedule instead.
Good systems is what will get me out of this situation.
In the past I expected too much from other people, but it's too rare to find someone strong enough to be able to take care of themselves and others.
What is great about my current challenges is that it's not presented anymore as Super Mario saving the princess. That was never really a motivating storyline for me. But it's building something for myself and people like me. Extremely happy that my new self reached the self-worth to work on such a story. :)
