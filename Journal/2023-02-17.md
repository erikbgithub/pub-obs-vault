# Journaling
Got my bug resolved and now seem to have something more predictable at hand. After some research my goal is to reorganise around events and state machines. Then such kind of sporadic bugs should be gone, too, as the code simply is more clear and logical.
Otherwise it feels like my life in Berlin is taking new shape again. Spent some time processing some new flavours.
