# Journaling

Learned about [LSM trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree).
Thought about how I can document [[Can I do a quick Godot RPG demo or not|my current exploration]] better, while doing it.
Also thought about how to split my [[Create optimistic Sci-Fi world|world creation task]] as this might be a longer topic either way, but the tasks I work on in my [[TODO|Kanban]] shouldn't be longer than a day or two in terms of workload.

I also need to work on some topics that somehow slipped through my daily routine.

#todo/money
- [ ] status social support
- [ ] status taxes
- [ ] status appartment search

Also got another idea for [[Mouses Maze Short Story]]. I struggled with having only a limited idea of how the Maze could be strategically interesting and maybe even competitive.
