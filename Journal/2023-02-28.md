# Journaling

I can't really say why I lost so much time in the morning. I remember I lost half an hour because I thought someone is in the bathroom prepping for the day, while actually the noises came from upstairs, the bathroom door was closed (which doesn't make much sense when this is where the air circulation comes from), the bathroom lights where on (which also doesn't make sense if nobody is in there) and yeah. I started to figure things out when the steps came from upstairs not from behind me. So much for good sound design.

Compiling Godot took a long time today. So I decided to research the next topic, which will be character design, instead of continuing the animation.

Was able to add some of the collision shapes to the tileset.
