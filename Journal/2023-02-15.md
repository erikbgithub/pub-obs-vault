# Journaling

I feel like my exploration of Sales has finished. I understand the sales people well enough now, that I think I can find out what my users need through talking to the sales people instead of hte customers directly. And I also have a good feeling for what the sales people need from us product people so they can do their job well. This way I might not have direct access to customer insights, but I can capture the input of multiple customers at once, and can focus more time on the things I care about: Making better products.

Had a lot of fun today with the refugee kids and with the debugging.
