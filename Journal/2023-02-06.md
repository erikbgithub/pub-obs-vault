# Journaling

After establishing a kind of regular daily life, I found I really struggle with just having a normal, predictable day. Nothing exciting. Just work, sports, eating, seeing the same faces. So I'm trying to put myself more into this situation. Reducing the special stuff, increasing the normal stuff. I'm trying to get into this mindset of meditative working, similar to drawing, but applying it to other normal activities. This way I would assume my expectation would shift from "oh my god, something needs to break or life is too boring" to "Hey, nice. Another calm day. Little progress on 2-3 areas."

As I ran into a pretty unclear problem yesterday with collision detection, I thought about focusing more on writing today. So thinking a lot about how to progress with [[Mouses Maze Short Story]].

Well, so much for the plans. I've finished the main loop of [[Sokoban Godot demo]] now, after getting an idea what to try next. The main problem was that scaling was inherited from a parent node, and it wasn't clear to me how it impacted all the math. Glad I found good debugging tools, visualisations and ideas from googling.
