# Journaling

Made progress with my tooth problem. Sadly, due to my current situation the more optimal solution is not possible and I have to accept to lose a tooth. I am prepared for that, though, as the dentists in Heidelberg already told me if we touch the tooth again, it has to be removed.
Also felt great to run for a long distance. For some reason running long is not as much a problem as running faster. I wonder what I'm missing in terms of training.
Then, after I took a rest, I felt really bad in my stomach and had to empty it. Not feeling fit enough for more stuff today.
