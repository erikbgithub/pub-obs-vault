# Journaling

Short and exhausting day. I learned that when I run and walk a lot I need corresponding refreshment in terms of water and probably some kind of minerals/vitamins. Took an iso drink today and it's fine now. That was my mistake before.
Figured out the current bug in my code, althouhg not really by solving the actual problem. Will move to the next for now.
