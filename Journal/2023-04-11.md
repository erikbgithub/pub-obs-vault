And i've missed my school's intro session to the sunday classes. I spent like 90% of the day thinking about nothing else but this school, and then I miss this one meeting, because in this instance I'm focused on something else and didn't even see any calendar pings. Even scrolling back now I don't see any btw. I somehow need another solution that actually works.
