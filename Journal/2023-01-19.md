# Journaling
Sleeping on the floor without a sleeping bag and matress is really not my thing.
Creating a [[Metamask]] [[wallet]] in my local [[Firefox]].
Creating a multisig [[wallet]] in [[Gnosis Safe]].
Started my first Blog post on [[Mirror.xyz]] about my life experiences and ideas.
I've decided to put the [[Budgeting]] task on hold for now, and focus on [[Content Creation]] first instead.
