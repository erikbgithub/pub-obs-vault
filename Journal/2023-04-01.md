# Journaling

Had pasta again for lunch and now I feel even more tired than before. Therefore, really taking it slowly today.
My todos are too much. But part of them can't be ignored at all, because I'm homeless. And part cannot be ignored because I have the commitment to do some progress every day, just as a training exercise.

I also feel like I still need to process a romantic encounter from the last days. I feel like I've learned a lot since my last [[unhealthy attachment]]. Which means, I got into a lot less trouble than ever before. The woman got into a lot less trouble than ever before. And we both actually encountered opportunities for growth, where we now both can choose by ourselves if we want to learn from them or not. I'm not fully satisfied with the result though.
