# Journaling
Today I have a lot of social appointments and opportunities. Honestly, I struggle with them being that much. I also want to have some time to continue on my projects. Social environments can give me energy, make me feel happy and make the time fly by quickly, e.g. yesterday's lunch event in the dome. But I also want to contribute to the world progressing a little bit each day.
