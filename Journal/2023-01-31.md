# Journaling

Acceptance. I think I have learned to accept quite a lot, about myself, other people, the world. So, if Bill Clinton would be my boss, and he would come to me and say, "I did not have any relations with that woman, Monica Lewinski", then I would still feel an appreciation for him as a human being, and I would wish him success and happiness from the deepest of my heart. But I wouldn't want him as my boss anymore, because that's as clear a lie as you can get. And not just that he's lying to me. There might be good reasons for that. If he says that with conviction he would lie to himself. People who value themselves so little are hard to trust, because they can't even trust themselves.

If at all, I would think about if there are any tasks for me to finish and clean up, if I could do them as a voluntary open source project instead of a billed task for the White House, and then I would be off, looking for other business partners.

Bye, Bill. May you live your days in peace, with other people around you.
